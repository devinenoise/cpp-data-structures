# Data Structures

Data structure is the way you organize data in the main memory during execution of a program.

## Arrays

An array is a collection of similar data elements.

_Declaration_ : int A[5];

_Initialization_ : int B[5]={2,4,6,8,10};

If you have an array of some size and don't define the elements they will become zero by default.
